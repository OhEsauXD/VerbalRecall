# **App Name**: Verbal Recall

## Core Features:

- Board Generation: Generate a memory game board with pairs of English and Spanish verb translations based on the selected difficulty level (Easy: 15 verbs, Medium: 30 verbs, Hard: 60 verbs).
- Card Display: Display the verb pairs face down on the game board.
- Matching Logic: Handle card selection and matching logic.  When two cards are selected, check if the verbs are translations of each other. If they match, keep them face up. If they don't match, flip them back over after a short delay.
- Progress Tracking: Display a move counter and a timer to track the player's progress.
- Game Completion: Detect when all pairs have been matched, and display a completion message with the final time and move count.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) for a calm and focused environment.
- Secondary color: Soft gray (#D3D3D3) for card backgrounds.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for matched cards and interactive elements.
- Clear and readable font for verbs on the cards.
- Simple, language-neutral icons for settings and hints (if any).
- Clean and organized layout for the game board, with difficulty selection prominently displayed.
- Subtle animations for card flipping and matching feedback.
